# Looking for a bootstrapping point

- Follow the tutorial of digital ocean: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js

:alert I gotta check this chance of networking and involving in salary-paid job, be back soon!

# Todo list

- Look for approriate intent and event for verification action
__UPDATE:__
```
:lore discord bot does not capture event of uncached messages - which are (by default) sent before the bot is started. To solve that, use partial as this suggests: https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/reactions.html#listening-for-reactions-on-old-messages -> the older messages are sent, the longer it takes since start to take effect.
:thought today I resist the urge to buy the domain name for this project cuz I dont want to feel pressure to launch, but I want to stay commited to this idea until the end of the road. So may the strength within me be found.
